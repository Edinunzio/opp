## Operation Pavlovian Positivity

Everyone's mad at the world. Life sucks, but advertising works. In a snarky "me first" world, kindness is a form of spiteful rebellion. 

### Kindness Campaign:
Distribute positive postcards using the same methods and design from marketing and advertising campaigns, but for the good of humanity. Repetition and eye-catching might catch on with some people, eventually. All the artwork unless otherwise specified, is my original work. This is mostly to avoid potential copyright issues.

### Prints:
Feel free to download and distribute anything in [here](https://github.com/Edinunzio/opp/tree/master/print). I'll be trying to do about 2 of these a month.

This is **not** a profit based campaign in any way, shape, or form. The overall goal, is a naive hope that advertising can be used for the power of good. If hate can be spread through rhetoric, so can love.
