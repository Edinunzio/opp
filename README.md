## Operation Pavlovian Positivity

Everyone's mad at the world. Life sucks, but advertising works. In a snarky "me first" world, kindness is a form of spiteful rebellion. 

### Kindness Campaign:
Distribute positive postcards using the same methods and design from marketing and advertising campaigns, but for the good of humanity. Repetition and eye-catching might catch on with some people, eventually. All the artwork unless otherwise specified, is my original work. This is mostly to avoid potential copyright issues.
